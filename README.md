 4. `node server/web`
 5. Browse to `http:localhost:3333`

## Known Issues:

 1. Profile images greater than ~25Mb are not supported.
 2. Undo is not implemented; this means remove is a bit clunky.
 3. Search is not implemented; this means specific contact selection is difficult.
 4. Support for many contacts is designed but not implemented; this is good for under 100 (not tested).
